Here children are not just given wings, but the school also ensures that they develop strong roots. Most importantly, children are loved and made to feel cherished so that they approach life with a positive attitude.

A spacious colorful school with a scientifically planned curriculum and computers opened the eyes of the parents to a new way of bringing up children.

A dive into our history
Yashshrri Preschool was formerly known as Yashshree Nursery & Playgroup.
</font>
<font size=5>

The school started with the former name in the year 2002 with only one student for 6 months. There after, numbers grew slowly and consistently giving the school its success and fame it has today.

Our strength has always been our family atmosphere where relationships are valued and students are nurtured and loved like our own.

Yashshrri Preschool has been the pioneer in preschool education and one of the oldest modern preschools in Ahmednagar city that has stood the test of time not just in terms of quality but also in terms of value based education in line with our motto -

"Education with Sanskriti"
